# zola-dadalg
An implementation of a niche board game called Zola. Includes two algorithms proposed by my Dad.

## **The Author:**
My name is Reed Bryan and I am currently a software engineering undergrad at the University of Victoria.
I started this project in 2022 and decided to finish and release it around 2 years later in December of 2023.
This is one of many projects I started but never managed to finish during that time.
Recently I’ve started applying for jobs so I’ve been working to put more of them online.
Back in 2020 I got really into game development after taking a computer programming course in the 10th grade.
I started with great block based visual programming language called scratch which helped me to build some good coding habits before I moved on to Unity.
Unity is a free commercial game engine used to create professional games played by millions of people and to create smaller projects like this one.
I’ve been using Unity for many years now and have a lot of appreciation for it as it's been a great source of learning and creativity for me.

## **The Project:**
I’d like to make it clear that I don’t take any credit for the game of Zola itself, only this program.
The original board game Zola was created by Mark Steere and can be played online on his website: <https://www.marksteeregames.com/>.
My Dad actually played Zola consistently on said website for a week or two back in 2022.
He always liked to analyze these types of games and would come up with algorithms that would make good AI for them.
Thus my inspiration for this project.
I was already into Unity at the time so I decided to program my own version of the game so he could play against and edit his algorithms.
The two AIs playable in this program are both based on algorithms he proposed, with some tweaking by me upon implementation.
The files for the easy and hard AIs are still named “DadAlgNum1” and “DadAlgNum2” in the final build of the game which I think is pretty funny.

Hope you enjoy,

Reed
